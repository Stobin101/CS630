  I have often thought about what makes a great website.  Well, to be honest, that's completely a lie.  I <em>rarely</em> think about what makes good websites.  I'm not a particularly good designer.  I spent some time reading design books this summer!  It was pretty fun, I suppose.  Let's see, what other books did I read this summer?  Well, I also read a book on D3 to prepare for this class.  It was <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/index.html">"Interactive Data Visualization for the Web"</a> by <a href="http://alignedleft.com/">Scott Murray</a>.  I didn't finish it; he seems to have not really finished the last chapter or so.  The stuff I read was good, too!

  You know, this is quickly turning into a demonstration of how <strong>not</strong> to write blog posts.  Maybe I shouldn't become a blogger, perhaps I ramble too much.  I'm mostly kidding, by the way.  I think I'd be a <em>great</em> blogger. I could blog about all kinds of things, like teaching, computer science, machine learning, raising a crazy child... There's no shortage of topics!  I could even create cool D3 data visualizations now that I've mostly finished reading that sweet book.

  Anyway, here is some code I wrote:
</p>
<pre>
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Hello, " + args[1]);
    }
}</pre>
